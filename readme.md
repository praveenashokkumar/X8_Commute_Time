Program to study how the new bus route for X8 is improving commute times?

Problem Statement: How is the new bus route for X8 improving commute times?

Alternate Hypothesis: The Average commute time for the new bus route X8 is lesser than the average commute time for the old commute route of X8.

Ha: newMean - oldMean < 0

Null Hypothesis: The Average Commute time for the new route is the same or longer than the old route.

H0: newMean - oldMean >= 0

Let us define the value of significance level α = 0.5 (5%)

So the Confidence Level would be 1-α = 95%

Z = \frac{\mu{pop} - \mu{sample}}{\sigma / \sqrt{N}}

z = (oldMean - newMean)/(oldStd/np.sqrt(len(data)))

If the value of p(Ha)-p(H0) > α

The Null Hypothesis can be rejected. In this case,

p(Ha)-p(H0) = 2.556397 - 2 (For 2 Std, Deviations Considered) = 0.556397

This value is greater than α

Therefore,

Since the value of Z>2 which is more than 2 Standard deviations above New Mean.

The Null Hypothesis Can be rejected
